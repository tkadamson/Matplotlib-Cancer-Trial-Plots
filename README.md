Three observations from the clinical trial data are listed below. This can also be found at the top of the main work book

#### Observation 1

Based on the topline summary (see Summary Statistics below), the drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane have significantly lower average tumor volumes compared the placebo and other regimens. Not only do these two regimens have the lowest mean and median average tumor volume-- 40.68 and 40.22 mm^3 average respecitively-- they also have the lowest standard deviation. This indicates that the drugs work more consistently across the population, as opposed to working on some mice and not on others. We can infer that these two drugs are the most promising for future trials

#### Observation 2
Also based on the topline summary, it is clear that some drugs are not effective at reducing tumor volume given that the mean and median are close to the plecebo volume of 54.03 mm^3. Naftisol, Stelasyn, and Ketapril seem to have no effect (average tumor volume is actually higher for the Ketapril regimen at 55.24 mm^3). From this, we can infer that these regimens require alteration and/or more study before continuing future trials. 

#### Observation 3
For the mice on the Capomulin regimen, average tumor volume is highly correlated to the individual mouse's weight. Given a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.8, that indicates a strong relationship between these two factors. In the future, I would like to examine this relationship across all regimens to see if the trend holds. If it does, that could be an area of future study to determine if weight might play a role in the progression of tumors.
